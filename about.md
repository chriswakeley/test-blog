            <div class="story-grid">
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>Founded in 2019, Serenity Flow Yoga emerged from a simple vision: to create a welcoming space where people of all backgrounds and abilities could discover the transformative power of yoga. Our founder, Maya Chen, began practicing yoga during a challenging period in her life and experienced firsthand how this ancient practice could bring peace, strength, and clarity.</p>
                    
                    <p>What started as a small community class in a rented studio has grown into a thriving yoga sanctuary. We believe that yoga is not about perfect poses or flexibility‚Äîit's about finding your breath, connecting with your body, and cultivating inner peace that extends far beyond the mat.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our studio is more than just a place to practice; it's a community where authentic connections are formed, personal growth is nurtured, and everyone is welcomed exactly as they are. We're committed to making yoga accessible to all bodies, all budgets, and all levels of experience.</p>
